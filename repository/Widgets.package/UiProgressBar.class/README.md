I am like a slide that is not interactive and has a label... and kind of a different appearance. :D

Actually, I am no slider. However, my API resembles that of one. I have a minimum (0 by default), a maximum (100 by default), and a currentValue.

My drawing code is optimized for speed. Thus, I do not support rich text but only simple messages.
